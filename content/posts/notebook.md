Hello, this is the notes section for my website, though it also functions as a kind of website within itself, hence the separate url. This is a home for all the posts that might not make the main section, sometimes because they are social media posts and other times becase they're first drafts or fragments. They will run the gamut from microblogging to poems and early drafts and anything else of a more ephemeral nature. Some of the content in this online notebook might go on to be promninent, canonical content but this still remains a place where I can throw off some random thoughts and post some awful poems.
