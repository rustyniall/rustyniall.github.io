Getting to the end of the academic year and my thoughts are circling the idea of a thing that I will make in the liminal time between the last bit of marking and when the kids finish school and are home for the summer. 

It would be lovely to be a constant fount of creativity all the time but life gets in the way when you're a knackered, middle aged parent. Little poems and other ephemera still hatch every now and then but nothing big. 

So it's really important to me that I send at least one monstrosity into the world every year, even if it's just so that I can know that this was the year where I made that particular thing as opposed to the year where I made that other thing.
