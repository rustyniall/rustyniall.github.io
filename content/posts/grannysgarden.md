# why does this site look like the BBC Micro game Granny's Garden but without the charming pixel art?

I've always been attracted to some retro aesthetics with my online stuff and normally can't resist a good typewriter font. This is probably because I started out as a serious writer with a typewriter and I often get nostalgic about those early days and the creative frenzy that accompanied them. But this site isn't about being a serious writer, it's about playing around and there's something about the 8/16 bit computer font that, for me, accentuates this playfulness. It also reminds me of all the Indie, Pico-8 and Bitsy games that seem to push the imagination further because of the boundaries they have to work through. I'm also reminded of afternoons copying code in BASIC from a page of a magazine into a ZX81 or Spectrum in the hope that, if I got it all right, a game would suddenly come into being from all that inpenetrable syntax. I guess that also takes me back to those typrewriter days spent hammering out words in the hope that something magical would happen.
